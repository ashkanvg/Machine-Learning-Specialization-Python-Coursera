1- Multiple Linear Regression 
2- Vecotrization
3- Gradient Descent for multiple linear regression
4- Normal Equation Method
5- Gradient Descent in Practice (CODE)
6- Feature Scaling
	- divid by maximum	--> x/max
	- normal		--> (x-mu)/(max-min)
	- standard division 	--> (x-mu)/sigma
6- Plot: Learnig Curve		--> plot cost-iteration
	- if increasing per a single iteration --> large learnign rate or bug
7- Feature Engineering
	- create new feature from our available features
8- Polynomial Regression --> non-linear function
9- Linear Regression with scikit-learn
